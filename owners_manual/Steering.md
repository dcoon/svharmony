## Steering
Spectra mechanical steering with aluminum crossbar and intermediate rudder posts. Crossbar bushings are bronze that don't require lubrication. Drag links have Teflon bushing that don't require lubrication but should have anti corrosion coating applied annually. Spectra cable is tensioned via a turnbuckle in the starboard transom.
### Rudders
Rudders are foam core, fiberglass, and West System epoxy over a stainless steel skeleton. The Starboard rudder was replaced in 2018. Port is original. Rudder and post bushings are Vesconite self lubricating UHMWPE plastic and should be greased during rudder service. 

An emergency tiller is located in the port transom. It is pushed down into the rudder posts via an access hatch on either hull. 
### Daggerboards
Daggerboards are red cedar core, carbon fiber skin, and West System epoxy. They were replaced in 2017. Bushings are marine exterior carpet epoxied inside the trunk tops and bottoms. Control lines are UHMWPE double braid through low friction rings led back to the cockpit.
### Autopilot
An Octopus LAM1212 hydraulic drive unit is connected via a drag link in the starboard transom.  A spare drive unit is in the starboard engine room by the water heater. Both take Valvoline Multi-Vehicle (ATF) Full Synthetic Automatic Transmission. The drive unit is controlled by a Garmin Reactor ECM located next to it.
