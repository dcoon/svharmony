### Shafts
Shafts are ISO 30mm Aqualoy built by Blair Propellers in Stuart, FL. They have a split coupler and Isoflex gearbox coupling IFC-4200-90 on the inboard end and an ISO 30mm tapered end for the propellers.    

PSS shaft seals take maintenance kit 07-30M-214R. New they are 168mm end to end including stainless collar and take about 20mm preload to stop spray. Set screws are 1/4" 20 x 5/16 316 cup screws. They are one of the few SAE fasteners on board. There is a dedicated SAE 1/4" allen key on board just for these.  Use blue loctite on the inner set screws.
### Propellers
Props are Seahawk Slipstream 3-blade S5 folding proellers made of stainless steel.

There is a spare prop in the starboard aft cabin under the bench seat. It is the original Flexofold 3-blade folding prop. It is heavily used but serviceable if needed.
### Fuel System
Integrated 400l fuel tanks in each hull. Secondary fuel filters are dual Racor R45P with A/B selector valve. Bleed screws are located on top of each Racor filter housing and on top of the primary filter located on the engine. After changing a Racor filter, open the housing bleed screw and push the black priming plunger until it primes and air bubble stop exiting the bleed screw. Once primed, gravity usually fills the filter and is sufficient to bleed the housing.
