## Preface
This manual was written in 2023 in anticipation of passing along information to new owners. It incorporates information from design documents, manuals, maintenance logs, and memory. It attempts to document everything accurately but errors and omissions are probable. Please consider it a draft and verify its accuracy against the actual systems onboard.

Harmony was a fantastic yacht for us and we hope she gives you the same joy and comfort.

Fair winds,
