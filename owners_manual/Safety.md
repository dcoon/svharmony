## Safety
### Thru Hulls
Through hulls are reinforced nylon skin fittings and ball valves by TruDesign ^[https://www.trudesign.nz/marine]. Threads are BSPP. Pipe joint compound is Highside Leak Lock^[https://www.jcwhitlam.com/Product/1/124/116#]. All skin fittings have a thickened epoxy ring surrounding the hole to protect the core. Below waterline thru hulls also have G10 reinforcement discs glued to the inner hull and load bearing collars to exceed the ABYC H27 standard.
