## Sails
### Main

CRW  - 2019

P: 18,200m
E: 6,450m

There are three reef points setup as a 2 point system. Reef rings in the luff are marked with colored lines (green, yellow, red) on the starboard side ring which can be secured to snap shackles on the mast. The clew is secured via colored reefing lines (green, blue, red) at the cockpit winch. Take care to tighten the topping lift beyond the red marker before loosening the main halyard to reef.

### Jib
Selftacking Furling Jib w/ Battens NPL Tour Xi White -
NorLam Xi14/11 CRW - 2019

I: 16,850m
J: 6,050m
Area: 50,44m2
LP: 95%

Maximum Apparent Wind (AWS) Speed Rating = 30kts

The jib halyard is stainless wire secured to a slider on the starboard side of the mast. To raise and lower the jib for maintenance, a temporary halyard extension labelled "Jib Halyard" is located in the rigging locker. Run the extension from the halyard wire thimble, down through the pad eye at the starboard side mast base, and up to the mast winch.

The furler is a ProFurl C420.
### Spinnaker
G2 Running Gennaker NorLon NO 250/150 - 2018

Isp: 18,150m
Jos: 7,880m
Area: 180,00m2

Maximum Apparent Wind (AWS) Speed Rating = 15 knts

Reefing the main to 2 in medium air and 3 in heavier air helps keep air in the spinnaker and can be faster than having more main.
### Code 65
Code 65 NPL Code Xi Xi09 CDT - 2019

Ios: 18,150m
Jos: 7,880m
Area: 127,08m2

Maximum Apparent Wind (AWS) Speed Rating = 20kts

The sail works well in very light air up to 80 TWA down to 145 TWA in heavier winds. It quickly loses power below 145 so switch to the asymm.  Reefing the main to 2 or 3 helps put air into the sail at deeper angles.

#### Code 65 Furler
The furler is a ProFurl NEX 8.0 with top down furling. To prevent corrosion in the snap swivel triggers (both halyard and drum swivels), remove the yellow plastic plates, clean, and fill with Tefgel annually. The code sail halyard is green w/ black flecks. There are 2 sets of sheets and soft shackles for the clew. Run around the shrouds through the back standup blocks then to the 2x manual winches in the cockpit. The spliced (continuous) furling line is tan and secured via a rolling hitch.
