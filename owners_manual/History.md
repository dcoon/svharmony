## History
### Build
Harmony was built in 2007 by Custom Marine in Knysna, RSA. She was meant to be its boat show centerpiece so was built to a high standard. Detailed construction plans can be obtained from Schionning Designs. The hull and decks are made from DuFLEX Balsa and strip planked red cedar covered in fiberglass and West Systems epoxy. Carbon reinforcements are placed in high stress areas. This makes for a very strong, stiff, and lightweight hull. DuFLEX Balsa panels are manufactured with epoxy "dams" every 4" in the balsa which limits moisture migration in the event of a penetration. The superstructure is a mix of DuFLEX, foam, and honeycomb core epoxy panels. The daggerboards are red cedar core, carbon fiber, and epoxy.  The rudders are foam, fiberglass, and epoxy over a stainless steel frame. 

Custom Marine experienced financial trouble after producing several hulls but the three partners still build quality catamarans in Knysna. James Turner owns Vision Yachts and builds the Vision 444. Julian Kneale owns Current Marine and continues to build Schionning catamarans. Don Tait owns Tait Marine, a prominent marine repair facility in Knysna. All three were consulted during the 2017 refit.
