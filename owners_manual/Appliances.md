### Washing Machine
A Bosch vent-less Washer Dryer is located in the port bow. It is powered by an AC breaker labelled "Washing Machine". There is a fresh water valve located next to the unit. It discharges through a 3/4" above waterline seacock in the port bow which is normally kept closed. 
### Ice Maker
The ice maker has a dedicated outlet behind the unit under the settee. There is a fresh water shutoff valve just behind the unit. Ice melt drains overboard via a small skin fitting.
### HVAC
A Webasto Blue Cool 12k BTU HVAC unit is located behind the settee near the galley sink. It is currently inoperable. The sea water pump is located in the port bilge beneath the lower inside pantry locker. It is plumbed to a strainer and 3/4" below waterline seacock which is kept closed when not in use. The strainer should be checked during use. It discharges through the galley sink drain above waterline. The condensation tray drains through a small port into the mast base drain compartment.
### Dive Compressor
Harmony originally was fitted with a dive compressor located in the port engine room. It was removed but the mounting platform and AC circuit were left in intact.
